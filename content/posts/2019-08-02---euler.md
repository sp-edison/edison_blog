##이론적 배경

###$\mathrm{IP}_{3}$  receptor channel
- Consists of an N-terminal beta- trefoil domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain
- The complex is formed of four 313 kDa subunits, with a large cytosolic domain with binding sites for various regulatory molecules, including $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ .
- Channel opening by $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$  is markedly cooperative (Hill number about 3), suggesting that when all four $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$  sites are occupied a single $\mathbf{C} \mathbf{a}^{2+}$ channel opens.

###Model of IP3 receptor channel
![Aspect ratio](/media/POST/000016/2.jpg)

Activation of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ receptors by sequential binding of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and $C a^{2+}$. $(a)$ The proposed sequence of events leading to $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ receptor activation is shown for only a single submit of the terametric $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ receptor. Binding of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ rapidly changes the conformation of the receptor exposing a $C a^{2+}$-binding site. $C a^{2+}$ then binds to this newly exposed site, and when all four submits of the receptor have bound $C a^{2+}$, the channel opens allowing $C a^{2+}$ to pass through. $(b)$ When cells are stimulated with supramaximal concentrations of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$the initial $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$-binding steps will be slower. 

The subsequent binding of $C a^{2+}$ to the newly exposed $C a^{2+}$-binding sites $(2)$ is relatively slow of the free cytosolic [$C a^{2+}$] is low, but faster when the cytosolic [$C a^{2+}$] is increased. When all four submits of the receptor have each sequentially bound $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and then $C a^{2+}$, the channel rapidly opens allowing $C a^{2+}$ to be released from the itracellular stores. $(3)$ In most cells, the resulting rise in cytosolic [$C a^{2+}$] causes a delayed inactivation of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ receptors. $(5)$ Activation steps compete with additional inactivation processes, which remain poorly understood but are probably initiated by $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ binding. $(4)$
We speculate that binding of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ to the first submit therefore initiates the race between inactivation and channel opening, the latter occurring only if each submit can bind $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and then $C a^{2+}$ within the timeframe dictated by the inexorable inactivation.

###Calculation of the open probability of IP3 receptor channel
![Aspect ratio](/media/POST/000016/3.jpg)

- C : closed state of ryanodine or $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ receptor channel
- O : open state
- I : inactivation state
- n : Hill coefficient
- $k$ : rate constant
- SR : sarcoplasmic reticulum
- $\left[\mathbf{C} \mathbf{a}^{2+}\right]_{\text { rel }}$ : $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration in the releasing pool of SR
- $\left[\mathbf{C} \mathbf{a}^{2+}\right]_{\mathbf{c y t}}$ : $\mathbf{C} \mathbf{a}^{2+}$ concentration in the cytosolic space
- $\left[\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right]_{\mathrm{cyt}}$ : $\mathbf{I P}_{3}$ concentration in the cytosolic space 


###The Stochastic Approach 
####The distribution of Random Time Intervals
Lifetime in any single state is exponentially distributed with mean = 1/(sum of transition rates that lead away from the state)

$$
f(t)=a_{1} \lambda_{1} e^{-\lambda_{1} t}+a_{2} \lambda_{2} e^{-\lambda_{2} t}+\cdots
$$


- $\lambda_{i}$ : the reciprocal of the time constant for the ith component 
- $a_{i}$ : the relative area occupied by the $i$th component 
- $n$ : number of components

$$
f(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{i=n} a_{i} \lambda_{i} e^{-\lambda_{i} t}
$$
