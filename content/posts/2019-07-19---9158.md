##Realistic case
####Rectangular waveguides are standard. 
####What is the aspect ratio of rectangular waveguides?
The interior of a standard rectangular wave guide has a 2:1 aspect ratio in most cases.

##Equations
####Eigenvalue equations, defined on $x y$ - plane
- TM Mode:
$$
\frac{\partial^{2} E_{Z}^{0}(x, y)}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} E_{Z}^{0}(x, y)}{\partial y^{2}}+h^{2} E_{Z}^{0}(x, y)=0
$$
- TE Mode:
$$
\frac{\partial^{2} H_{z}^{0}(x, y)}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} H_{z}^{0}(x, y)}{\partial y^{2}}+h^{2} H_{z}^{0}(x, y)=0
$$

####Boundary conditions 
- Upper/lower plates
- Left/right plates

##Exercise
####In order to enhance your understanding on the subject,
A waveguide simulator has been developed. Using the web browser, please visit https://nano.edison.re.kr

##Simulation name
####Input the simulation name and the description:
It’s up to you.

##Parameters
####Two input𝑎parameters, a and b. 
They are in [cm].

Default values are corresponding to the WG16.

##Submit and monitor
####Wait, it will take some seconds. Then, you will eventually see the green light, “success”.
You can select the post-processor. (Visualization tool)

##WG16
####It has 𝑎 = 2.29 cm and 𝑏 = 1.02 cm 
- 25% margin for the lower bound
- 5% margin for the upper bound

- The lowest cutoff frequency is 6.55 GHz.
- The second lowest cutoff frequency is 13.10 GHz. (From what? TE20 mode.)


##Origin of different modes
####Now, select “ImageViewer” tool. 
You will see the modes in the cross section.

##Analogy
####Infinite potential well problem 
Inside 2D well,
$$
-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m}\left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y^{2}}\right) \psi(x, y)=E \psi(x, y)
$$

Yes, this Schrödinger equation has the same form.

The solution has the form of
$$
\psi(x, y)=A_{m n} \sin \left(\frac{m \pi}{a} x\right) \sin \left(\frac{n \pi}{b} y\right)
$$

##Ground state = dominant
####From this analogy,
The ground state (whose energy is lowest) is corresponding to the dominant mode (whose cutoff frequency is lowest).

The energy of an eigenmode (𝑚, 𝑛) is given by 

$$
E_{m n}=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m}\left(\frac{m \pi}{a}\right)^{2}+\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m}\left(\frac{n \pi}{b}\right)^{2}
$$

Of course, 𝑚≠0 and 𝑛≠0.(No particle at all)

The term related with the long side, $\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m}\left(\frac{m \pi}{a}\right)^{2}$, generates smaller contribution to $E_{m n}$, because that $\frac{1}{a}<\frac{1}{b}$. 


##TM solution
####Back to our problem
- Electric Field
$$
\begin{aligned} E_{Z}^{0}(x, y) &=E_{0} \sin \left(\frac{m \pi}{a} x\right) \sin \left(\frac{n \pi}{b} y\right) \\ h^{2} &=\left(\frac{m \pi}{a}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{n \pi}{b}\right)^{2} \end{aligned}
$$

- Cut off frequency
$$
f_{c}=\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\mu \epsilon}} \sqrt{\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{n}{b}\right)^{2}}
$$

##Dominant TM mode, TM
####Since 𝑚 ≠ 0 and 𝑛 ≠ 0,
The dominant TM mode becomes $\mathrm{TM}_{11}$ mode. 

Cutoff frequency:
$$
f_{c}=\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\mu \epsilon}} \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^{2}}
$$

##TE Solution
Only the boundary conditions are different!

Magnetic field:
$$
\begin{aligned} H_{z}^{0}(x, y) &=H_{0} \cos \left(\frac{m \pi}{a} x\right) \cos \left(\frac{n \pi}{b} y\right) \\ h^{2} &=\left(\frac{m \pi}{a}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{n \pi}{b}\right)^{2} \end{aligned}
$$

Cut off frequency:
$$
f_{c}=\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\mu \epsilon}} \sqrt{\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{n}{b}\right)^{2}}
$$
- Same with TM mode
            

##Dominant TE mode, TE
####Since one of 𝑚 and 𝑛 may be zero, 
The dominant TE mode becomes $\mathrm{TE}_{10}$ mode.
(Why TE10 instead of TE01?) 

Cutoff frequency:
$$
f_{c}=\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\mu \epsilon}} \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)^{2}}<\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\mu \epsilon}} \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^{2}}
$$

Therefore...

$\mathrm{TE}_{10}$ mode is the dominant mode of a rectangular waveguide.


##Things to be checked
####Let’s check the followings!
In the rectangular waveguide, $\mathrm{TM}_{00}$ mode (or $\mathrm{TM}_{10}$ or $\mathrm{TM}_{01}$) is not allowed. Therefore, the TEM mode cannot be the dominant mode.

For given (𝑚, 𝑛), the cutoff frequency is the same. However, since the lowest allowed pair is different between two cases, the $\mathrm{TE}_{10}$ mode becomes the dominant mode.


##Homework
####Consider a standard waveguide. 

####Specification:
- Calculate the recommended frequency range. (25% lower margin, 5% upper margin)
- Change the aspect ratio of your waveguide by 20% longer a and 20% shorter a.
- Discuss about the change of the frequency range.
- (Total 3 simulations at least!)
