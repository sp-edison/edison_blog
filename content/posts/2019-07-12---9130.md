## Heat transfer equation
Fourier law of heat conduction
![Aspect ratio](/media/POST/9130/0.jpg)


Heat flow rate - The transfer of energy from the more energetic to less energetic particles

Energy conservation
The first law of thermodynamics is simply a statement that the total energy of a system is conserved.
