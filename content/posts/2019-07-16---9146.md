##Input Parameters
![Aspect ratio](/media/POST/9146/0.jpg)

1. Mass 1 : Mass of Particle 1, in unit of (kg)


2. Radius 1 : Radius of Particle 1, in unit of (m)


3. Initial position 1 (x, y) : Initial position of Particle 1, in unit of (m)
* Z value is always 0, because we treat the 2-dimensional problems. 


4. Initial velocity 1 (x, y) : Initial velocity of Particle 1, in unit of (m/s)
* Z value is always 0, because we treat the 2-dimensional problems. 2

5. Mass 2 : Mass of Particle 2, in unit of (kg)


6. Radius 2 : Radius of Particle 2, in unit of (m)


7. Initial position 2 (x, y) : Initial position of Particle 1, in unit of (m)
* Because we treat the 2-dimensional problems, Z value is always 0.
* Initial velocity 2 is zero. In this simulation, we only assume that particle 2 is initially at rest.

##Case Study
####Objective:

Using the path of particle 1 & 2, we will understand the laws of conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic energy in (perfectly) elastic collision.

The initial positions of particle 1 & 2 are (0.0, 5.0, 0.0) and (10.0, 6.0, 0.0), respectively.

Here, particle 1 has a velocity but particle 2 is initially at rest. Velocity of Particle 1 : (5.0, 0.0, 0.0).

In this simulation, we only consider 2-dimensional problems.
