##Introduction
Ksec2d-AE is a two-dimensional (2D) finite element based cross-sectional analysis software for nonhomogeneous anisotropic beams based on reduced elasticity approach [1]. The present code Ksec2d-AE 1.7 should not be confused with that of Ksec2d-WM [2, 3], the latter is based on an entirely different and rather simpler weighted-modulus approach. The present analysis is applicable for beams with any arbitrary geometric shape and material distribution. The elastic couplings (such as bending–torsion, extension–torsion) are also incorporated in the present Ksec2d-AE which are missing in the wighted-modulus approach of Ksec2d-WM [2, 3]. The present analysis is developed from an energy-consistent formulation with correctly derived reduced material elastic constants matrix (hence the name reduced elasticity approach). The code is written in Fortran 90 exploiting modular programming for maintainability and requires little memory bandwidth with higher efficiency.

![Aspect ratio](/media/POST/000023/0.jpg)

The flowchart of Ksec2d-AE is shown in Fig. 1.1. The present version can compute a 5 × 5 sectional stiffness matrix with generalized Euler–Bernoulli level for bending, and Vlasov level for torsion (nonuniform torsion due to torsional warping restraint). Ksec2d-AE is capable of accurately calculating the out-of-plane torsional warping displacement for nonhomogeneous anisotropic beams. The mass and inertial properties (mass moments of inertia) are also provided as outputs which are essential for the dynamic analysis. The sectional offsets such as shear center (SC), tension center (TC), and mass center (MC, also called as center of gravity) are also generated in the output. Additionally, the elastic and inertial properties are transformed with reference to sectional offsets to provide user with freedom to choose the global reference axes. The recovery analysis can be performed to compute strains and stresses under the given loading conditions. The multiple loadcases can be analyzed in a single run. For the failure analysis, the strength ratio can be calculated using von-Mises criterion for isotropic materials, and Tsai-Hill or Hoffman or Tsai-Wu criteria for composite materials.

This guide presents the description of input and output file formats for the analysis of any arbitrary beam section using Ksec2d-AE.

In case, Ksec2d-AE is used for the research purposes, the following reference must be cited:

###1.1 Ksec2d-AE coordinate systems
The schematic of the beam section with reference coordinate system is shown in Fig. 1.2. The x-axis is the beam reference axis which can be arbitrarily defined by the user. The beam section lies on the yz-plane. In Ksec2d-AE, two additional coordinate systems are defined which are needed for orthotropic or anisotropic materials, as shown in Fig. 1.3. The fiber orientation θ3 (also called ply angle) defines the orientation of fibers in a layer about the z-axis (see Fig. 1.3a). For curved geometries, fiber plane orientation θ1 is defined to transform the material constitutive relations about the beam reference axis (see Fig. 1.3b). Note that the fiber plane orientation is defined for each element since the finite elements with orthotropic or anisotropic material can have variable orientations based on the geometry.

For the finite element analysis, various types of elements are available which include 3- and 6-noded triangular elements, and 4- and 8-noded quadrilateral elements, shown in Fig. 1.4. Note that the hybrid mesh consisting of multiple element types (e.g., 8-noded quadrilateral and 6-noded triangular elements) is also available in Ksec2d-AE to model complex sectional shapes. The locations of nodes with the numbering scheme, and the locations of Gauss-points for numerical integration are also shown in the figure. The user must practice caution during input preparation for the node numbering in quadratic elements where corner nodes precede the mid-nodes in element connectivity.

###1.2 Main features

##Input
For the analysis of an arbitrary beam cross-section, the discretization must be performed first using available finite elements. The following data are needed as input:

1. Material properties: The material elastic constants must be specified for isotropic, or- thotropic, and anisotropic materials.

2. Fiber orientation (θ3): The fiber orientation θ3 is required for each layer of orthotropic or anisotropic material.

The mesh data can be generated using any available preprocessor such as MSC.Patran [4]. MSC.Patran can be used to generate input in NASTRAN format (*.bdf) or neutral format (*.out, the extension not to be confused with Ksec2d-AE output) which can then be translated into Ksec2d-AE input format described in the next section.

The fourth line contains the date and time stamp when the output file was generated along with the Ksec2d-AE version. Next, the wall time consumed in the solve phase (excluding input and output) is printed in seconds.

####Block 3: Principal Axes Orientations
This block prints the orientations of principal bending axes (along which bending-bending coupling deformation vanishes) and principal inertial axes (along which product of mass moments of inertia vanishes) in degrees.

####Block 4: Radii of Gyration
This block prints the polar radius of gyration ($k_{p}$) computed with respect to the tension center, and mass radius of gyration ($k_{m}$) computed with respect to the mass center.

####Block 5: Mass Matrix (Inertial Properties)
This block prints a 4 × 4 mass matrix given as:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cccc}{m} & {0} & {m z_{m c}} & {-m y_{m c}} \\ {0} & {I_{y y}+I_{z z}} & {0} & {0} \\ {m z_{m c}} & {0} & {I_{y y}} & {-I_{y z}} \\ {-m y_{m c}} & {0} & {-I_{y z}} & {I_{z z}}\end{array}\right]
$$

where m is the mass per unit length, $y_{m c}$, $z_{m c}$ represent the location of mass center, $m y_{m c}$ and $m z_{m c}$ are the first mass moments of inertia, $I_{y y}$ and $I_{z z}$ are the second mass moments of inertia, and $I_{y z}$ is the product of mass moment of inertia. The values are given in the global coordinate system, with respect to the coordinate system located at the mass center, and about the principal inertial axes. Note that the origin of principal inertial axis is located at the mass center and rotated by the principal inertial axes orientation.

####Block 6: Geometric Matrix (Geometric/Area Properties)
This block prints a 4 × 4 geometric matrix given as:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cccc}{A} & {0} & {\widetilde{Q}_{y}} & {-\widetilde{Q}_{z}} \\ {0} & {\widetilde{I}_{y y}+\widetilde{I}_{z z}} & {0} & {0} \\ {\widetilde{Q}_{y}} & {0} & {\widetilde{I}_{y y}} & {-\widetilde{I}_{y z}} \\ {-\overline{Q}_{z}} & {0} & {-\overline{I}_{y z}} & {\widetilde{I}_{z z}}\end{array}\right]
$$

where $A$ is the sectional area, $\widetilde{Q}_{y}, \widetilde{Q}_{z}$ are the first moments of inertia, $\widetilde{I}_{y y}, \widetilde{I}_{z z}$ are the second moments of inertia, and $\widetilde{I}_{y z}$ is the product of inertia. The values are given in both the global coordinate system and with respect to the coordinate system located at the geometric center (centroid).


####Block 7: Stiffness Matrix
This block prints a 5×5 Euler–Bernoulli–Vlasov like sectional stiffness matrix (or beam constitutive matrix) K given as:

$$
\mathbf{K}=\left[\begin{array}{lllll}{K_{11}} & {K_{12}} & {K_{13}} & {K_{14}} & {K_{15}} \\ {K_{12}} & {K_{22}} & {K_{23}} & {K_{24}} & {K_{22}} \\ {K_{13}} & {K_{23}} & {K_{33}} & {K_{34}} & {K_{35}} \\ {K_{14}} & {K_{24}} & {K_{34}} & {K_{44}} & {K_{45}} \\ {K_{15}} & {K_{25}} & {K_{35}} & {K_{45}} & {K_{55}}\end{array}\right]
$$

where the numbers are represented as: 1–extension; 2–torsion; 3,4–bending (about y- and z-axes); and 5–torsional warping. The torsional warping stiffness and related couplings are usually important for open section beams with boundary restraint effects.

For isotropic beams without any elastic couplings, the stiffness matrix becomes

$$
\mathbf{K}=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}{E A} & {0} & {0} & {0} & {0} \\ {0} & {G J} & {0} & {0} & {0} \\ {0} & {0} & {E I_{y}} & {0} & {0} \\ {0} & {0} & {0} & {E I_{z}} & {0} \\ {0} & {0} & {0} & {0} & {E C_{\omega}}\end{array}\right]
$$

where $EA$ is the extensional stiffness, $GJ$ is the torsional stiffness, $E I_{y}, E I_{z}$ are the bending stiffnesses, and $E C_{\omega}$ is the torsional warping stiffness. The values are given in the global coordinate system, with respect to the coordinate systems located at the tension center and shear center, and with respect to the principal bending axes. Note that the origin of principal bending axes is located at the tension center and rotated by the principal bending axes orientation.

####Block 8: Flexibility Matrix
This block prints a 5 × 5 Euler–Bernoulli–Vlasov like sectional flexibility matrix $\mathbf{S}$ which is obtained by taking inverse of the stiffness matrix $\mathbf{K}\left(\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{K}^{-1}\right)$. Similar to the stiffness matrix output, the values are given in the global coordinate system, with respect to the coordinate systems located at the tension center and shear center, and with respect to the principal bending axes.

####Block 9: Minimum/Maximum Strains, Stresses and Strength Ratio
This block is printed only when the recovery analysis is performed. The minimum and maximum values of the sectional strains and stresses for each load case (when multiple load cases are defined) are reported at the Gauss points and at the element centroids. In addition, if failure analysis is also requested, the minimum and maximum values of the strength ratio are also printed in the output.

###3.2 ParaView Files
The ParaView [6] files in Ensight Gold format [5] are also generated for the visualization of mesh data, and contours of torsional warping function, strains, stresses, and strength ratio. The *.case file is the main model file which can be opened using ParaView.

The ParaView outputs can be visualized by following the simple steps given below:

1. Open *.case file in ParaView.

2. Click Apply under Properties.

3. Select warping in the drop-down list showing Solid Color.

4. To change the view from shaded to wireframe or shaded with wireframe, check the drop-down list showing Surface.

The snapshot of ParaView displaying the warping contour is shown in Fig. 3.1. For additional details, refer to ParaView documentation available at www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView.
