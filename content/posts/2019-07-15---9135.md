##Theory of Hall Effect
###Hall effect
The Hall effect is the production of a voltage difference (the Hall voltage) across an electrical conductor, transverse to an electric current in the conductor and a magnetic field perpendicular to the current. It was discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879.

###Lorentz force
When a magnetic field is present that is not parallel to the direction of motion of moving charges, these charges experience a force, called the Lorentz force.

### Theory
For a simple metal where there is only one type of charge carrier (electrons) the Hall voltage $V_H$ is given by
  
$$
V_{H}=-\frac{I B}{n e t}
$$  

where I is the current across the plate length, B is the magnetic field, t is the thickness of the plate, e is the elementary charge, and n is the charge carrier density of the carrier electrons.


The Hall coefficient is defined as

$$
R_{H}=\frac{E_{y}}{j_{x} B}
$$

where j is the current density of the carrier electrons, and Ey is the induced electric field. In SI units, this becomes

$$
R_{H}=\frac{E_{y}}{j_{x} B}=\frac{V_{H} t}{I B}=-\frac{1}{n e}
$$

(The units of RH are usually expressed as m3/C, or Ω·cm/G, or other variants.) As a result, the Hall effect is very useful as a means to measure either the carrier density or the magnetic field.
