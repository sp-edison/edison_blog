###Energy band structure?
![Aspect ratio](/media/POST/9129/0.jpg)

In solid-state physics, the band structure of a solid describes those ranges of energy that an electron within the solid may have(bands), and ranges of energy that it may not have(bandgaps or forbidden bands). Band theory derives these bands and bandgaps by examining the allowed quantum mechanical wave functions for an electron in large, periodic lattice of atoms or molecules.

Band structure calculations take advantage of the periodic nature of crystal lattice.
The single electron Schrodinger equation is solved for an electron in a lattice-periodic potential, giving Bloch waves as solutions:

$$
\boldsymbol{\psi}_{\boldsymbol{n} \boldsymbol{k}}(\boldsymbol{r})=\boldsymbol{e}^{i \boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{r}} \boldsymbol{u}_{\boldsymbol{n} \boldsymbol{k}}(\boldsymbol{r})
$$

where $\mathbf{k}$ is called wavevector. For each value of $\mathbf{k}$, there are multiple solutions to the Schrodinger equation labelled by $\boldsymbol{n}$ (band index, numbers the energy bands). Each of these energy levels evolves smoothly with changes in $\mathbf{k}$, forming a smooth band of states.


###K.p theory
Using the k.p method, one can obtain analytical expressions for the band dispersion. It allows the extrapolation of the band structure over the entire Brillouin zone. The k.p method can be derived from the one-electron Schrodinger equation:


$$
H \phi_{n}(r)=\left(\frac{p^{2}}{2 m}+V(r)\right) \phi_{n}(r)=E_{n} \phi_{n}(r)
$$
(1)

Here ùêª denotes the one-electron Hamiltonion operator and V(ùëü) the periodic lattice potential. The wavefuntion of an electron in an eigenstate labeled ùëõ and its energy are denoted by $\phi_{n}(r)$ and $E_{n}$, respectively.

In an periodic potential Bloch‚Äôs theorem applies, and the solution of (1) can be expressed as

$$
\phi_{n k}(r)=e^{i k \cdot r} u_{n k}(r)
$$
(2)

where ùëõ is the band index, ùëò a wave vector, and $\mathrm{u}_{\mathrm{n} k}(r)$ has the periodicity of the lattice.



###K.p theory
Assuming that the potential $V(r)$ is local, one can substitute $\phi_{n k}(r)$ into (1) to obtain an equation for $u_{n k}(r)$ :

$$
\left(\frac{p^{2}}{2 m}+V(r)+\frac{\hbar k \cdot p}{m}\right) u_{n k}(r)=\left(E_{n k}-\frac{\hbar^{2} k^{2}}{2 m}\right) u_{n k}
$$
(3)

Considering any fixed wavevector $k=k_{0}$, the above equation yields a complete set of eigen- functions $u_{n k_{0}}$ , which completely span the space of lattice periodic functions in the real space.
Hence, the wavefunction $\phi_{n k}(r)$ at ùëò can be expanded in terms of $u_{n k_{0}}$ :

$$
\phi_{n k}(r)=\sum_{n^{\prime}} C_{n, n^{\prime}}\left(k, k_{0}\right) e^{i k \cdot r} u_{n^{\prime} k_{0}}
$$
(4)

Once, $E_{n k_{0}}$ and $u_{n k_{0}}$ are known, the functions $\phi_{n k}(r)$ and the eigenenergies $E_{n k}$ at any $k$ vector $k_{0}+\Delta k$ in the vicinity of $k_{0}$ can be obtained by treating the term $\hbar \Delta k \cdot p / m$ in (3) as a perturbation. Either degenerate or nondegenerate perturbation theory has to be used.




The band structure can be found by solving eigenvalue problem of 8x8 k.p hamiltonian.
The 8x8 k.p hamiltonian is given by
