## Theory of npn BJT

###BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor)

A type of transistor that relies on the contact of two types of semiconductor for its operation

#### Base

The base is physically located between the emitter and the collector and is made from lightly doped, high resistivity material

#### Collector

The collector surrounds the emitter region, making it almost impossible for the elctrons enjected into the base region to escape being collected.

#### Emitter

The emitter is heavily doped, while the collector is lightly doped, allowing a large reverse bias voltage to be applied before the collector-base junction breaks down.

###Active mode
- Current : $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{E}}=\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{B}}+\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{C}}$

- Voltage : $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{BE}}>\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{TH}}, \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{CE}}>\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{BE}}$
