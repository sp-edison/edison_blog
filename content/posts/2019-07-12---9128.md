##Structure of a MOSFET

The basic structure of a MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor)

##Theoretical equation for I-V in a MOSFET
The relation between drain current and gate (or drain)voltage is given by
$$
I_{D}=\frac{Z}{L} \mu_{n} C_{o x}\left(V_{G}-V_{T}-\frac{V_{D}}{2}\right) V_{D} \quad \text { for } \quad V_{D}<\left(V_{G}-V_{T}\right)
$$

Here, Z and L are given in the below picture.

$\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{ox}}$ is capacitance per thickness of oxide given by $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ox}} / \mathrm{d}$.

$\mu_{\mathbf{n}}$ is electron mobility.

$\mathrm{v}_{\mathrm{G}}, \mathrm{v}_{\mathrm{b}}, \mathrm{v}_{\mathrm{T}}$ are gate, drain, and threshold voltages, respectively.


##Simulation results and theory
The equation is applicable for fitting I-Vg in higher Vg and I-Vd in lower Vd.

##Fitting procedure
1. I-Vg fitting and determining threshold voltage VT.
At first, obtain I-Vg result.
Draw both the I-Vg result and the theory curve with VT=0.
Shift the theory curve until the two curves match with each other.

2. I-Vd fitting
Obtain I-Vd result.
Compare the I-Vd result and the theory curve with VT obtained above.

## Software of analyze MOSFET

[MOSFET_analyzer App link](https://www.edison.re.kr/web/nano/scienceappstore/-/scienceapp/MOSFET_analyzer/1-0-1/view)

Calculate a current by voltage of gate or source at the MOSFET(metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor). Iterative calculation of the continuity equation and poisson equation.


### Geometry of the designed n-channel MOSFET
![Aspect ratio](/media/POST/9128/6.jpg)

The black region is electron doping region. Nd is electron doping density.

The yellow region is hole doping region. Na is hole doping density.

The channel length can be taken as 1.6 um from the design.

Z is set to be 1 um.

##Parameter information
![Aspect ratio](/media/POST/9128/7.jpg)

The default values of intrinsic carrier density (ni), hole mobility(μp), and electron mobility (μn) are often taken in the case of Si.

Hole doping density (Na) and electron doping density (Nd) can be changed a little from the default values.

IV mode 1: I-Vg / IV mode 2: I-Vd

Fixed Voltage is
Vd fixed in the I-Vg mode or Vg fixed in the I-Vd mode

Initial V, Final V, and V step are Vg values in the I-Vg mode and Vd values in the I-Vd mode.
