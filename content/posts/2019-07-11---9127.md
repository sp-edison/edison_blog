## What is energy band in semiconductor?

Most of device engineers are familliar with energy band in the left-hand figure. The band is the group of conduction band minima and valence band maxima along transport direction under parabolic effective mass approximation. How about nanostructures such as nanowire?

## Tight-binding theory

Energy band calculated under the assumption that atoms are tightly-bound. In 1-D chain model, we understand simple tight-binding Hamiltonian.

## Generic model with tight-binding (TB) theory
E-k relation obtained by solving eigenvalue problem of $E\left\{\phi_{0}\right\}=[h(\vec{k})]\left\{\phi_{0}\right\}$

## Overall flow chart
To obtain the band structures using semi-empirical TB model,

1. Define the unit cell (the smallest atomic structure)
2. Find periodicity based on the connectivity of the unit cell
3. Construct Hamiltonian with orbital basis functions

## Methodology : Bulk

Bulk unitcell : 1 anion + 1 cation → 2 atoms only
Number of orbitals per a atom must be selected → usually $\operatorname{sp}^{3} s^{\star}$


Bulk Hamiltonian :

$$
[h(\vec{k})]=\sum_{m}\left[H_{n m}\right] e^{i \vec{k} \cdot\left(\vec{d}_{m}-\vec{d}_{n}\right)} \quad \text { where } H_{n m}=\left[\begin{array}{ll}{H_{a a}} & {H_{a c}} \\ {H_{c a}} & {H_{c c}}\end{array}\right]
$$

4 nearest neighbor atoms 

$$
\begin{array}{ll}{\frac{a}{4}(\hat{x}+\hat{y}+\hat{z}),} & {\frac{a}{4}(-\hat{x}-\hat{y}+\hat{z})} \\\\ {\frac{a}{4}(\hat{x}-\hat{y}-\hat{z}),} & {\frac{a}{4}(-\hat{x}+\hat{y}-\hat{z})}\end{array}
$$


basis vector $\vec{d}_{m}-\vec{d}_{n}$
$$
\begin{array}{l}{\frac{a}{4}(\hat{x}+\hat{y}+\hat{z}), \frac{a}{4}(-\hat{x}-\hat{y}+\hat{z})} \\\\ {\frac{a}{4}(\hat{x}-\hat{y}-\hat{z}), \frac{a}{4}(-\hat{x}+\hat{y}-\hat{z})}\end{array}
$$

### Example of energy band structures : Bulk 
Obtained from $s p^{3} d^{5} s^{*}$ tight-binding model

### Methodology : ultra-thin-body (UTB) STEP 1
 ![image](/media/POST/9127/5.jpg)


Step 1
- UTB is confined in z-direction
- UTB has periodicity in x-, y- direction 
- Atomic structure must be known

 ![image](/media/POST/9127/6.jpg)



### Methodology : ultra-thin-body (UTB) STEP 2
 ![image](/media/POST/9127/7.jpg)

Step 2
- Find unitcell in UTB
- Generally, unitcell is like chain shape in UTB structure
- No typical way to find chain

### Methodology : ultra-thin-body (UTB) STEP 3
 ![image](/media/POST/9127/9.jpg)

Step 3
- Connectivity information is needed 
- In this S/W, the nearest neighbor approximation is used
- Distinguish anion and cation

### Methodology : ultra-thin-body (UTB) STEP 4~6
 ![image](/media/POST/9127/11.jpg)

Step 4 ~ Step 6
- Hamiltonian constructed with neighbor map and empirical parameters
- Surface atoms must be passivated

### Example of energy band structures : UTB
- Obtained from $s p^{3} d^{5} s^{*}$ tight-binding model
- 2D energy contour within k-space

### Methodology : nanowire (NW)
 ![image](/media/POST/9127/14.jpg)

#### Step 1 ~ Step 2
- NW is confined in y-, z-direction
- UTB has periodicity in x- direction
- Unitcell in NW is called ‘slab’
- Slab differs according to transport direction

 ![image](/media/POST/9127/15.jpg)

#### STEP 3~4
 ![image](/media/POST/9127/16.jpg)

- Make connectivity information between nearest neighbor atoms
- The information is used to contruct Hamiltonian of NW
 ![image](/media/POST/9127/17.jpg)

### STEP 5~6
 ![image](/media/POST/9127/18.jpg)

- Surface atoms are passivated by unitary transformation.
- Passivation eliminates spurious states in forbidden gap
- E-k relation is obtained by EVP S5. Passivation for dangling bonds

### Quantization effect : quantized energy

- Conduction band minimum shifted up due to quantum confinement effects 
- Valence band maximum shifted down due to quantum confinement effects

  ![image](/media/POST/9127/20.jpg)



### Quantization effect : quantized effective mass

- Effective masses can vary along k-direction.
- Effective mass along transport dir. (mx) is increased as thickness of UTB decreases.
- Effective mass along confinement dir. (mz) is increased as thickness of UTB decreases.

###Example of energy band structures : NW

- Obtained from $s p^{3} s^{*}$ tight-binding model
- Dislike bulk, Si NW has direct band-gap because of quantum confinement effect. 
- You should understand delta-valley shifting for these phenomena.
