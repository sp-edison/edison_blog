##Abstract
This software realizes the Haynes-Shockly experiment.

![Aspect ratio](/media/POST/9131/0.jpg)

From this simulation, you can find mobility, diffusion coefficient, and life-time of minority carrier, simultaneously.

##Governing Equations
- 1D time-dependent Drift-Diffusion Equations for Electron and Hole

$$
\begin{array}{l}{J_{p}=e \mu_{p} p E-e D_{p} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}} \\ {J_{n}=e \mu_{n} n E+e D_{n} \frac{\partial n}{\partial x}}\end{array}
$$

- Continuity Equation

$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{\jmath}+\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=-R
$$

SRH(Shockley-Read-Hall) 이론 적용 $R=\frac{n p-n_{i}^{2}}{\left(n+n_{1}\right)+\left(p+p_{1}\right)}$

- 1D Poisson Equation:

$$
\nabla^{2} \psi=-\frac{q\left(p-n-N_{a}+N_{p}\right)}{\epsilon_{0}}
$$
 
##Input parameters

Since this simulation assumes n-type semiconductor, the minority carrier is hole.

The measurement location is 5 μm away from the pulse-creation position in this simulation.

##Output 1. Animation of the moving pulse

##Output 2. Minority carrier pulse values with increasing time

Mobility and diffusion coefficient can be obtained by the following formula.

$$
\begin{aligned} \mu_{p} &=\frac{d}{\mathrm{E}_{0} t_{0}} \\ D_{p} &=\frac{\left(\mu_{p} \mathrm{E}_{0}\right)^{2}(\Delta t)^{2}}{16 t_{0}} \end{aligned}
$$

Here, d is 5 μm, and Δt is the time gap between the two times at which the charge value is 1/e of the peak value.

##Output 3. Area vs. peak time
Area below the graph in output 2 vs. peak time obtained at various bias values.

 The life-time of the minority carrier can be obtained by

$$
S=K \exp \left(\frac{-t_{0}}{\tau_{\rho 0}}\right)=K \exp \left(\frac{-d}{\mu_{p} \mathrm{E}_{0} \tau_{p 0}}\right)
$$
