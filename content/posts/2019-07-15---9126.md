## Time-evolution operator
Time-evolution operator 𝑈(𝑡)

$$
|\psi(t)\rangle=\widehat{U}(t)|\psi(0)\rangle
$$

$\widehat{U}(t)$ is Hermitian operator.

In order for probability to be conserved as time evolves,

$$
\begin{aligned}\langle\psi(t) | \psi(t)\rangle &=\left\langle\psi(0)\left|\widehat{U}^{\dagger}(t) \widehat{U}(t)\right| \psi(0)\right\rangle \\ &=\langle\psi(0) | \psi(0)\rangle \end{aligned}
$$

And consequently the operator $\widehat{U}(t)$ must be unitary:

$$
\widehat{U}^{\dagger}(t) \widehat{U}(t)=1
$$

The Hamiltonian $\widehat{H}$, the energy operator, enters as the generator of time translations through the infinitesimal time-evolution operator:

$$
\widehat{U}(d t)=1-\frac{i}{\hbar} \widehat{H} d t
$$

The time-evolution operator obeys the differential equation

$$
\hat{H}(t) \widehat{U}(t)=i \hbar \frac{d}{d t} \widehat{U}(t)
$$

leading to the Schrodinger equation:

$$
\widehat{H}|\psi(t)\rangle= i \hbar \frac{d}{d t}|\psi(t)\rangle
$$

A particularly useful solution to (*) occurs when the Hamiltonian is independent of time, in which case the time-development operator is given by

$$
\widehat{U}(t)=e^{-i E t / \hbar}
$$


The action of the time-development operator on an energy eigenstate $|E\rangle$ is given by

$$
e^{-i \hat{H} t / \hbar}|E\rangle= e^{-i E t / \hbar}|E\rangle
$$

Showing that a single energy eigenstate just picks up an overall phase as time evolves and is therefore a stationary state.


##Superposition of energy eigenstates
- Time evolution for a state operator $|\psi(t)\rangle$

$$
|\psi(0)\rangle=\sum_{n}\left|E_{n}\right\rangle\left\langle E_{n} | \psi(0)\right\rangle
$$

is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}|\psi(t)\rangle &= e^{-i \widehat{B} t / \hbar} \sum_{n}\left|E_{n}\right\rangle\left\langle E_{n} | \psi(0)\right\rangle \\ &=\sum_{n} e^{-i E_{n} t / \hbar}\left|E_{n}\right\rangle\left\langle E_{n} | \psi(0)\right\rangle \end{aligned}
$$

When the superposition involves states with different energies, the relative phase between the energy eigenstates changes with time. The time in this case satisfies

$$
\Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$

where ∆𝐸 is the usual uncertainty in energy for the state $|\psi\rangle$.

- Suppose two stationary states,

$$
\Psi_{1}(x, t)=\psi_{1} e^{-i \omega_{1} t} \text { and } \Psi_{2}(x, t)=\psi_{2} e^{-i \omega_{2} t}
$$

where $\hbar \omega_{1}=E_{1}$ and $\hbar \omega_{2}=E_{2}$ are the corresponding energies.

To be definite, we could consider $\psi_{1}$ and $\psi_{2}$ to be the lowest two wave functions of the finite potential well with n=1 and 2. The linear combination of these two states,

$$
\Psi(x, t)=c_{1} \Psi_{1}(x, t)+c_{2} \Psi_{2}(x, t)
$$

for any two imaginary numbers $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$.

- In the time-dependent Schrodinger equation: 

$$
\begin{aligned} i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x, t) &=c_{1} \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi_{1}(x, t)+c_{2} \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi_{2}(x, t) \\\\ &=c_{1}\left(-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+U(x)\right) \Psi_{1}(x, t)+c_{2}\left(-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+U(x)\right) \Psi_{2}(x, t) \\\\ &=\left(-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+U(x)\right) \Psi(x, t) \end{aligned}
$$

- The resulting state is not a stationary state.

$$
\begin{aligned} \Psi(x, t) &=c_{1} \psi_{1}(x) e^{-i \omega_{1} t}+c_{2} \psi_{2}(x) e^{-i \omega_{2} t} \\\\ &=e^{-i \omega_{1} t}\left[c_{1} \psi_{1}(x)+c_{2} \psi_{2}(x) e^{-i \omega^{\prime} t}\right] \end{aligned}
$$

where $\omega^{\prime}=\omega_{2}-\omega_{1}$.

$$
|\Psi(x, t)|^{2}=\left|c_{1} \psi_{1}(x)+c_{2} \psi_{2}(x) e^{-i \omega^{\prime} t}\right|^{2}
$$

If $c_{1}$ or $c_{2}$ is not zero, this state is dependent of time. If $c_{1}$ or $c_{2}$ is zero, this state is stationary states.

- If $c_{1}=c_{2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$

$$
\begin{aligned}|\Psi(x, t)|^{2} &=\frac{1}{2}\left|\psi_{1}(x)+\psi_{2}(x) e^{-i \omega^{\prime} t}\right|^{2} \\\\ &=\frac{1}{2}\left|\psi_{1}(x)^{2}+\psi_{2}(x)^{2}+2 \psi_{1} \psi_{2}(x) \cos \left(\omega^{\prime} t\right)\right|^{2} \end{aligned}
$$

where 
$$
\omega^{\prime}=\frac{\left(E_{2}-E_{1}\right)}{\hbar}
$$

Because of the factor 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜔`𝑡), the probability density vary with time. In this case the time dependence is periodic, with period $\tau=\frac{2 \pi}{\omega^{\prime}}$. When the difference of energy of two states is increased, period(or ∆𝑡) is decreased.
