##UChem 4.0.2 Manual
26 Sept. 2018
Cheol Ho Choi Kyungpook National University

##Background
####Aug. 2012: 
Initiated by Cheol Ho Choi at Kyungpook National University on Aug. 2012. The software was created mostly for educations.

####Feb. 2015: 
Geometry Optimization function is Included.

##Capabilities
- Both RHF and B3LYP theories
- Energy as well as gradient calculations 
- Geometry Optimizations
- 6-31G and 6-31G(d) basis sets

##Limitations
- Current basis sets are only for 1st and 2nd row elements.
- Only Restricted shells (RHF) can be calculated. Therefore, ROHF and UHF cannot be performed.

##General Input Formats
- Natom : The total number of atoms to be included. • Atomic number and Cartesian Coordinates
- Hamilton: Either HF or DFT can be used.
- Basis: Either 6-31G or 6-31G(d) can be used.
- Charge: The total charge of a molecule • Runtype: Energy, gradient or optimize

##Input Examples ($\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}$)
![Aspect ratio](/media/POST/00006/0.jpg)

This a geometry optimization of $\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}$ with B3LYP/6-31G(d) theory.

Note that Hamilton = dft means B3LYP.

##Output Example ($\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}$)

A successful geometry optimization job should say as in the output example

Gradients are sufficiently small....

####So Geometry Optimization Successfully Completed at 15 STEPS

A successful geometry optimization shows the optimized geometries on the Top-right panel as the figure left.

##Input Examples (Alanine Dipeptide)
