##Problems
###Problem 1.

The built-in potential at the PN junction is determined by the doping density ($𝑁_𝑎, 𝑁_𝑑$). For the PN junction (silicon), find the built-in potential when $𝑁_𝑎=1 ×10^{18} 𝑐𝑚^{−3}$,  $𝑁_𝑑=1×10^{16} 𝑐𝑚^{−3}$. However, suppose the PN junction is homogeneous and its length is infinite.

As the doping density increases, the built-in potential also tends to increase. When $𝑁_𝑑=1×10^16$, find the built-in potential for $𝑁_𝑎 =1×10^{17} 𝑐𝑚^{−3}$,  $1×10^{18} 𝑐𝑚^{−3}$,  $1×10^{19}  𝑐𝑚^{−3}$ and see how the built-in potential increases with doping density of the value

###Problem 2.

The space charge region at the PN junction is determined by the doping density (𝑁_𝑎, 𝑁_𝑑). For the PN junction (silicon), find the length of the space charge region when $𝑁_𝑎=1 ×10^{18} 𝑐𝑚^{−3}$,  $𝑁_𝑑=1×10^{16} 𝑐𝑚^{−3}$. However, suppose the PN junction is homogeneous and its length is infinite.

###Problem 3.

The built-in potential was obtained from problem 1 when $𝑁_𝑎=1 ×10^{18} 𝑐𝑚^{−3}$,  $𝑁_𝑑=1×10^{16} 𝑐𝑚^{−3}$. Use this value to calculate the length of the space charge region. Also, compare the values ​​calculated through the formula with the values ​​obtained through simulation.

###Problem 4.

The width of the space charge region at the PN junction is affected by the doping density. When $𝑁_𝑑=1×10^{16}$, find the length of the space charge region for $𝑁_𝑎= 1×10^{16} 𝑐𝑚^{−3}$,  $1×10^{17} 𝑐𝑚^{−3}$,  $1×10^{18}  𝑐𝑚^{−3}$ and see how the length of the space charge region varies with the doping density.

###Problem 5.

When $𝑁_𝑑=1×10^{16}$, see where the electric field is most strongly affected and how the size changes for $𝑁_𝑎= 1×10^{16} 𝑐𝑚^{−3}$,  $1×10^{17} 𝑐𝑚^{-3}$,  $1×10^{18}  𝑐𝑚^{−3}$.

###Problem 6.
####Neaman 8.2 
A silicon pn junction has impurity doping concentrations of $Nd = 2 x 10^{15} cm^{-3}$ and $Na = 8 x 10^{15} cm^{-3}$. Determine the minority carrier concentrations at the edge of the space charge region for $Va = 0.45 V$.

###Problem 7.
####Neaman 8.4 
The doping concentrations in a silicon pn junction are $Nd = 5 x 10^{15} cm^{-3}$ and $Na = 5 x 10^{16} cm^{-3}$. The minority carrier concentration at either space charge edge is to be no larger than 10 percent of the respective majority carrier concentration. Determine the maximum forward-bias voltage that can be applied to the junction and still meet the required specifications. 

###Problem 8.
#### Streetman 5.1
An abrupt Si p-n junction has $Na=10^{18} cm^{-3}$ on one side and $Nd=5 x 10^{15}cm^{-3}$ on the other.

(a) Calculate the Fermi level positions at 300K in the $p$ and $n4 regions.

(b) Draw and equilibrium band diagram for the junction and determine the contact potential $V_o$ from the diagram.

###Problem 9.
####Neaman Ex 8.1
A silicon pn junction at $T = 300 K$ is doped with impurity concentrations of $N_{d} = 2 x 10^{16} cm^{-3}$ and $Na = 5 x 10^{16} cm^{-3}$. The junction is forward biased at $Va = 0.65V$. Determine the minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edges. Does low injection still apply? 

###Problem 10.

Simulate the relationship between the total current flowing in the PN junction diode and the voltage for each voltage by increasing the bias voltage from 0 V to 1.0 V in 0.1 V increments and plotting it with a logarithmic scale to check whether the nonlinear section appears. ($N_{d} = 10^{16} cm^{-3}$, $Na = 6x10^{15}cm^{-3}$, $T = 300K$ )
