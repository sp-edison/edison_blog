- A small air gap between the probe and the sample acts as a potential barrier.
- Energy of an electron is less than the energy of a free electron by an amount equal to the work function.
- Electrons can tunnel through the barrier to create a current in the probe.
- The current is highly sensitive to the thickness of the air gap.
- As the probe is scanned across the sample, the surface structure is mapped by the change in the tunneling current.
